## Technologies Used

  - react
  - react-router
  - Babel
  - Webpack
  - Standard
  - eslint

## Purpose

  After taking a react fundamental course I did the course project to deepen what I learned.  Decided to add it to my portfolio just to show basic knowledge of react and
  react-router.

## Challenges

  Setting up the initial environment with webpack, babel, eslint and standard.  Was a little more lengthy than I anticipated because it was my first time and I got a little experimental, taking parts from different tutorials that I liked and putting them in this project.

## Aha Moment

  When I reused the form component in the header and it worked like it was suppose to.
