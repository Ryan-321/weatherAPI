# WeatherAPI

## Technologies Used

  - react
  - react-router
  - Babel
  - Webpack
  - Standard
  - eslint

## Purpose

  After taking a react fundamental course I did the course project to deepen what I learned by practicing.  Decided to add it to my portfolio just to show basic knowledge of react and
  react-router.

## Challenges

  Setting up the initial environment with webpack, babel, eslint and standard.  Was a little more lengthy than I anticipated because it was my first time and I got a little experimental.  I found this part the most fun.  Next most challenging part was passing around the data and trying to compose my components in the right way.  Remembering that data flows down in react helped.

## Aha Moment

  When I reused the form component in the header and it worked like it was suppose to.  

## Note

  If you clone this down to play around with it you will need your on API key.
