# WeatherAPI

## Technologies Used

  - react
  - react-router
  - Babel
  - Webpack
  - Standard
  - eslint

## Purpose

  After taking a react fundamental course I did the course project to deepen what I learned by practicing.  Decided to add it to my portfolio just to show basic knowledge of react and
  react-router.

## Challenges

  Setting up the initial environment with webpack, babel, eslint and standard.  Was a little more lengthy than I anticipated because it was my first time and I got a little experimental.  I think next time I will use react-create-app.  Inline CSS.  It still doesn't feel right to me.  Need to do a little more research on best practices, but for this small app I thought it was fine.

## Aha Moment

  When I reused the form component in the header and it worked like it was suppose to.  

## Note

  If you clone this down to play around with it you will need your on API key.
